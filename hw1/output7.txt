but the:0:you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him
but the:0:nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor
but the:0:why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise
but the:0:i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely
but the:0:you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
but the:0:might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere
but the:0:the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
but the:0:a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket
but the:0:we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed
but the:0:then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape
but the:0:we are at present doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks
but the:0:mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
but the:0:it is our french gold whispered the director
but the:0:we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it
but the:0:your french gold
but the:0:yes
but the:0:we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30000 napoleons from the bank of france
but the:0:it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar
but the:0:the crate upon which i sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
but the:0:our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
but the:0:which were very well justified observed holmes
but the:0:and now it is time that we arranged our little plans
but the:0:i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head
but the:0:in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern
but the:0:and sit in the dark
but the:0:i am afraid so
but the:0:i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carree you might have your rubber after all
but the:0:but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light
but the:0:and first of all we must choose our positions
but the:0:these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful
but the:0:i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those
but the:0:then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly
but the:0:if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down
but the:0:i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched
but the:0:holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced
but the:0:the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice
but the:0:to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault
but the:0:they have but one retreat whispered holmes
but the:0:that is back through the house into saxe coburg square
but the:0:i hope that you have done what i asked you jones
but the:0:i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door
but the:0:then we have stopped all the holes
but the:0:and now we must be silent and wait
but the:0:what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us
but the:0:my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier in breath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director
but the:0:from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor
but the:0:suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
but the:0:at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
but the:0:then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light
but the:0:for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor
but the:0:then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones
but the:0:its disappearance however was but momentary
but the:0:with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern
but the:0:over the edge there peeped a clean cut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulder high and waist high until one knee rested upon the edge
but the:0:in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
but the:0:its all clear he whispered
but the:0:have you the chisel and the bags great scott jump archie jump and ill swing for it
but the:0:sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar
but the:0:the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts
but the:0:the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
but the:0:its no use john clay said holmes blandly
but the:0:you have no chance at all
but the:0:so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness
but the:0:i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coat tails
but the:0:there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes
but the:0:oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely
but the:0:i must compliment you
but the:0:and i you holmes answered
but the:0:your red headed idea was very new and effective
but the:0:youll see your pal again presently said jones
but the:0:hes quicker at climbing down holes than i am
but the:0:just hold out while i fix the derbies
but the:0:i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists
but the:0:you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins
but the:0:have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please
but the:0:all right said jones with a stare and a snigger
but the:0:well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police station
but the:0:that is better said john clay serenely
but the:0:he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective
but the:0:really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you
but the:0:there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience
but the:0:i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay said holmes
but the:0:i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red headed league
but the:0:you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the encyclopaedia must be to get this not over bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day
but the:0:it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better
but the:0:the method was no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplices hair
but the:0:the 4 a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week
but the:0:from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation

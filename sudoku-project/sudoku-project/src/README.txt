INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS SUDOKU GAME::

Use the left and right arrow keys to move around. Alternatively you can click in any cell you wish to edit.

Instead of pressing "C" on the keyboard to check the current board input values, we added a "CHECK" button that allows
players to see whether their input is correct or not. This seems more intuitive and anyone could use it.

If you want to use a custom file to play sudoku, make sure to edit lines 52 and 54.

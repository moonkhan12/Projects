DRIVER FILE: sudokuGame.java

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS SUDOKU GAME::

Use the left and right arrow keys to move around. Alternatively you can click in any cell you wish to edit.

Instead of pressing "C" on the keyboard to check the current board input values, we added a "CHECK" button that allows
players to see whether their input is correct or not. This seems more intuitive and anyone could use it without having to be told to 
press "C" to check their work.

If you want to use a custom file to play sudoku, make sure to edit lines 64 and 66. 
NOTE: These lines may appear at a different location depending on what program is used to run sudokuGame.java
